# [2455. Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-317/problems/average-value-of-even-numbers-that-are-divisible-by-three/)
## **Difficulty:**  `Easy`

---

Given an integer array nums of positive integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by 3.

Note that the average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]
Output: 9
Explanation: 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3. (6 + 12) / 2 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,7,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no single number that satisfies the requirement, so return 0.
```

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int averageValue(int[] nums) {
        int count=0;
        int sum=0;
        double avg=0.0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]%2==0 && nums[i]%3==0)
            {
                count++;
                sum=sum+nums[i];
            }
        }
        if(count==0 || sum==0)
            return 0;
        else{
             avg=sum/count;
            return (int)Math.round(avg);
        }
    }
}
